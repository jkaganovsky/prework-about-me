      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a full-time Research Coordinator at the University of Washington Medical Center, a mother to 2 young children, and currently enrolled at UW's Coding Boot Camp.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in the Philippines until I moved to the US in 1996.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I've recently picked up and enjoy gardening and sewing this past spring. I also love to knit and crochet during the winter season.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to be able to maintain and develop webpages and continue to help my fellow co-workers in the healthcare system.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Seattle, Washington</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>For as long as I can remember, I was always computer and tech savvy. I have always been curious about how web pages are built, and what type of codes were used. I am very excited with this new adventure I have taken, and hopefully be able to utilize this newfound skill to build a webpage for my current employer to help ease the workflow of my healthcare team.</p>
